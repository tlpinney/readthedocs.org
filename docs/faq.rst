Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

My project isn't building with autodoc
--------------------------------------

First, you should check out the Builds tab of your project. That records all of the build attempts that RTD has made to build your project. If you look at your build page, and you see problems with import errors, it's likely that you aren't whitelisted. Virtualenv and pip options won't work without being whitelisted.

If you need autodoc or other custom options, feel free to Contact Us either in IRC at #readthedocs, or by email at eric@ericholscher.com.


How do I change behavior for Read the Docs
-------------------------------------------

When RTD builds your project, it sets the `READTHEDOCS` environment variable to the string `True`. So within your Sphinx's conf.py file, you can vary the behavior based on this. For example::

    import os
    on_rtd = os.environ.get('READTHEDOCS', None) == 'True'
    if on_rtd:
        html_theme = 'default'
    else:
        html_theme = 'nature'

I get import errors on librarires that depend on C modules
----------------------------------------------------------

This happens because our build system doesn't have the dependencies for building your project. This happens with things like libevent and mysql, and other python things that depend on C libraries. We can't support installing random C binaries on our system, so there is another way to fix these imports.

You can mock out the imports for these modules in your conf.py with the following snippet::

    import sys

    class Mock(object):
        def __init__(self, *args):
            pass

        def __getattr__(self, name):
            return Mock

    MOCK_MODULES = ['pygtk', 'gtk', 'gobject', 'argparse']
    for mod_name in MOCK_MODULES:
        sys.modules[mod_name] = Mock()

Of course, replacing `MOCK_MODULES` with the modules that you want to mock out.
